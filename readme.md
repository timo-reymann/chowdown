# Chowdown

A simple, plaintext recipe database for hackers, filled with my recipes

[http://chowdown.io](http://chowdown.io)

# Getting Started

This is a Jekyll build. Make sure you have Jekyll [installed](https://jekyllrb.com/). To install, run this command in the terminal (or iTerm, etc):

```gem install bundler jekyll```

or to check if you've got it installed already:

```jekyll -v```

Clone or download this repo. Navigate to the folder in terminal (or iTerm, etc), and then run:

```jekyll serve```

With default settings, you should be able to view the site locally at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`

# Writing a Recipe

The recipes are stored in the collection "Recipes" (the folder /_recipes).

They are written in Markdown and contain a few special sections:

- The frontmatter, which contains:
 - Title, Image, and Layout (which is "recipe")
 - Ingredients (a list of things in the dish)
 - Directions (a list of steps for the dish)
- Body content (for intros, stories, written detail)

If you need help with Markdown, here's a [handy cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
