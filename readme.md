recipes (Chowdown)
===

A simple, plaintext recipe database for hackers, filled with my recipes.

## About
All recipes are in german ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª!

This is a growing collection of my favorite recipes that i personally cooked/baked and really enjoyed!

This is based on the amazing work of [clarklab](https://github.com/clarklab): [chowdown](https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown).


## Getting Started
This is a Jekyll build. Make sure you have Jekyll [installed](https://jekyllrb.com/). To install, run this command in the terminal:

```gem install bundler jekyll```

or to check if you've got it installed already:

```jekyll -v```

Clone or download this repo. Navigate to the folder in terminal (or iTerm, etc), and then run:

```jekyll serve```

With default settings, you should be able to view the site locally at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`


## Writing a Recipe
The recipes are stored in the collection "Recipes" (the folder /_recipes).

They are written in Markdown and contain a few special sections:

- The frontmatter, which contains:
    - Title, Image, and Layout (which is "recipe")
    - Ingredients (a list of things in the dish)
    - Directions (a list of steps for the dish)
- Body content (for intros, stories, written detail)
